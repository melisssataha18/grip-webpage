Determine where poles might fail and caused a fire risk, public
safety risk, or outage due to expected wind speeds and gust (hardening), and unexpected
high wind speeds and gusts (higher than designed for) to perform risk analysis, inform
grid hardening, emergency practices and vegetation management, improve operations
practices and provide situational awareness.

### Description of the process/scenario:
Run scenarios for either 1) expected or 2) unexpected wind
events. Determine poles that are vulnerable. Manual process will entail looking for correlation with
high fire areas, and non-high fire risk areas with vegetation that could be a fire risk. Provide pole
replacement program with prioritized list of poles that should be hardened. Provide area whether flied
crews should be staffed week of wind event, to respond quickly and provide situational awareness to
field crew the day of, during a ‘red flag’ event.

The table below illustrates the sequence of tasks to accomplish this scenario.
